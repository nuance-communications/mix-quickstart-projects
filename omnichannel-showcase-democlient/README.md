# Integration Tips ðŸ’¡

## Code Setup

### Step 1. Create an AzureCommunicationServices Resource

* Go to the Azure Portal.
* Create a "Communication Services" resource
* Create a phone number (Send and Receive SMS)

### Step 2. Create an AppService for handling ACS Events, App: SMS Connector

* Create an EventGrid Listener.
* Event Subscription within ACS to point to the EventGrid Listener
  * Resource > Events > + Subscription > WebHook > URL to API (/api/updates)
* Create an App Service for the SMS Connector - processing Inbound and Outbound interactions
* Event Subscription within ACS to point to the SMS Connector App
  * Resource > Events > + Subscription > WebHook > URL to API (/api/sms-topic-event-triggered)

See [README](./code/sms-connector/README.md) for more.

### Step 3. Update the Demo Client Middleware and Handler Mapping

* Copy the function into `api/`
* Update the Data Access Mapping in the client `dlgaas.js`

See [README](./code/middleware/README.md) for more.

### Step 4. Update Environment Variables

#### SMS Connector
Provide `acs_conn_str` and `acs_phone_number` pointing to the AzureCommunicationServices resource and phone number acquired, from Step1.
Provide the appropriate Mix Application Client Credentials obtained from the Mix.dashboard.

#### Demo Client
Provide `sms_connector_endpoint` pointing to the AppService from Step2.
